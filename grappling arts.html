<p>Grappling refers to techniques, maneuvers, and counters applied to an opponent in order to gain a physical advantage in hand-to-hand combat, such as improving relative position, escaping, submitting, or injury to the opponent. Grappling is a general term that covers techniques used in many disciplines, styles and martial arts that are practiced both as combat sports and for self-defense.</p>

<p>Traditionally, grappling was always synonymous with the combative sport of wrestling. Back then, wrestlers were called grapplers and grapplers were called wrestlers. During traditional grappling competitions, two unarmed opponents engaged in a hand-to-hand struggle, and the goal was to throw your opponent to the ground and gain control over him. These competitions separated themselves from boxing arts by disallowing strikes.</p>
